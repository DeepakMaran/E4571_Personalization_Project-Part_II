    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Book crossing is a website that enables free sharing of books, either with friends or with complete strangers by wild-releasing books in public places. They offer optional paid membership for new members that includes features like book recommendation. These recommendations direct to the Better World Books website which is an online book-selling portal.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, better top-k recommendations generate revenue to Bookcrossing in two ways:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    1.Better recommendations translate to purchases at World Books and Bookcrossings gets a share.\n",
    "    2.Personalized recommendations leads to user satisfaction resulting in retention of users and brand value. This contributes to revenue through paid memberships as new users would opt for the optional membership and existing users would continue to pay to retain the membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, our business objective is to generate k recommendations(top-k recommendation) for users logged into bookcrossings website.\n"

    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "We built a top-k recommendation engine for this task and explored neighborhood and model based collaborative filtering models for this task using collaborative filtering techniques in Part A. However, these methods are not able to recommend latest books to users as they have not been reviewed enough times. But recommending new books in the market that are relevant to the users is integral to driving sales for that book, and in turn for bookcrossing to generate revenue. In this project, we hope to design  recommender system that addresses this book cold start problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another important business objective is to generate personalized recommendations to new users to encourage them to opt for paid membership.  However, the collaborative filtering models we explored in Part A do not perform very well on new users who do not have enough rating history yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus our objective is to generate recommendations that work reasonably well even for new members and latest books. \n"

    "We design a hybrid recommender system that generates recommendations to users. We use multiple hybridization strategies to combine predictions from a subset of the following three models:\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### 1. kNN\n",
    "   When implemented the k-nearest neighbor method, we found out that taking item-based similarity is seen to perform better than user-based similarity. The search for users in a large user population is the bottleneck in user-based methods. This is overcome by instead exploring relationships between items first which are smaller in number. A basic item-based kNN model with the Pearson similarity is seen to work best for our dataset.The basic kNN model was found to work best with respect to the evaluation metrics we want to optimize for. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. SVD Matrix Facotorizaton\n",
    "Due to SVD’s simplicity and effectiveness when using explicit data, we choose SVD matrix factorization as one of our models. The SVD model will learn the bias, such as certain users might not be very critical and tend to rate all book highly, or some users tend to rate all book very low. Also consider about the global bias term the follow formula shows the prediction used by SVD model. \n",

    "The bias bu and the factors pu are assumed to be zero when user u is known. Similarly. When an item is known, the bias bi and the factor qi are assumed to be zero. The rating matrix is very sparse, which is with a density of 0.841%. We overcome this by adding regularization terms of the objective function. Here the goal is to minimize the following regularized regularized squared error.\n",

    "    1). Item profile creation\n",
    "    Once an item profile is created for each of the items in the dataset using the feature engineering methods described above, we estimate the rating user $u$ gave to item $i$ ($r_ui$) using a set ($I$) of $k$ items that are most similar to item $i$ among all the items user $u$ has rated.  Cosine distance between the two item profiles was used as proxy for similarity. Thus, the rating for user $u$ and item  $i$  is estimated as:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
